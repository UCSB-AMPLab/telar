name: Test Telar Scripts
#
# Telar's build pipeline is driven by Python scripts in the scripts/ directory.
# These scripts handle everything from fetching Google Sheets data to processing
# CSV files, generating IIIF image tiles, and producing the Jekyll collections
# that make up a Telar site.
#
# This workflow runs the unit test suite for those scripts on every push and
# pull request to main. The tests live in tests/unit/ and cover the core
# processing logic: CSV parsing, column normalisation, widget rendering, IIIF
# metadata extraction, glossary linking, image processing, and more. They run
# against the scripts/telar/ package, which is the modular form of the build
# pipeline introduced in v0.7.0.
#
# The tests are pure logic tests — they don't need a running Jekyll server,
# network access, or real Google Sheets data. They use pytest with mocked
# inputs and verify outputs against expected values.
#
# Version: v0.7.0-beta

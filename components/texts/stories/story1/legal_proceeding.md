title: A Legal Proceeding
---

The crown prosecutor of the New Kingdom of Granada sued Maldonado y Mendoza in 1603, accusing him of having defrauded the monarchy by buying vast, fertile lands at a very low price.

During the litigation, both parties presented opposing visions of the territory. While Maldonado y Mendoza described it as an unproductive marsh, the prosecutor considered it to be fertile savanna.

During the case, this map was meant to serve as proof to determine which party was correct. For this purpose, imperial officers were ordered to explore the territory, see it with their own eyes, and draw it on paper so that it could be presented in court to help reach a decision. As they sketched their observations on paper, the savanna became an object of study for the court in accordance with the monarchy's legal framework.

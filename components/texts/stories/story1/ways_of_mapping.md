## What is a map?

Different societies depict the world in different ways. There are visual, oral, and mental maps. In some societies, a name, a hat, or clothes can also serve as a map.

![Definition of MAPA from 1611 dictionary](https://paisajescoloniales.com/assets/img/def-mapa.jpg)

"MAP, is what we call the board, canvas, or paper in which all or particular lands are depicted, it may come from *mappa*, which means canvas or fabric, particularly the ones praetors in the circus would send as a signal for the games to begin, which was whitened or treated with clay, or starched as we say, and because the canvas on which the land, the sea, and its places were depicted was prepared in this way, it was called map, or mappa mundi, and for this reason we also call these depictions canvases, as they are drawn on canvas."

## [[kogi-loom|The Kogi Loom]]

Among the Kogi people of the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta, for example, the loom is made as a map that depicts the geography of their home region.

Among the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta, a loom—in addition to being a tool for weaving—is a map that represents the human body and the geography of the Sierra.

The body of a man with his arms crossed forms the shape of the loom. In turn, the four corners of the loom represent the four cities of the lowlands (Santa Marta, Rioacha, Fundación, and Valledupar), while the crosses that shape the interior represent the mountain peaks.

The form of the loom creates a frame with which the Kogi conceptualize and represent geography and which can also be expressed on their bodies.

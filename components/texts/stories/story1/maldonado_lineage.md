## The Mayorazgo

The trial ratified Maldonado y Mendoza's rights to his estate. In his will, Maldonado y Mendoza transformed his estate into a *mayorazgo*—an entailed estate. This meant that following his death it would not be divided between his heirs but would pass on to his eldest child, Antonio Maldonado de Mendoza.

![Definition of MAYORAZGO from 1611 dictionary](https://paisajescoloniales.com/assets/img/def-mayorazgo.png)

"MAYORAZGO, the first-born son of a noble house, which the eldest son inherits, from the Latin primogenitus, and the Greek protogonos. We also call a mayorazgo the estate or land destined and allotted to the eldest son. It is beyond our purpose to say more on this subject, as major authors, classical and modern, have written whole volumes on it, which may be consulted."

## The Lineage

This was the beginning of a powerful lineage that grew around the estate.

This property was known as the "Meadow of Bogotá," the *mayorazgo* of Bogotá, or the Steer Yard, because the estate temporarily held [[livestock|cattle]] driven up from the lowlands for consumption in the city of Santafé de Bogotá. Maldonado y Mendoza's heirs continued to marry into some of the most distinguished families in the New Kingdom of Granada, and eventually received titles of nobility and established the Marquisate of San Jorge.

The lineage maintained its power for two centuries, producing viceroys and bishops. As a matter of fact, [[jorge-tadeo-lozano|Jorge Tadeo Lozano]], who became the first president of the republic in 1811, was a descendant of the Maldonados.

## Jorge Tadeo Lozano

Jorge Tadeo Lozano was born in Bogotá in 1771. He studied in Europe and became interested in natural history. This allowed him to join the Royal Botanical Expedition in New Granada in 1803 as the person in charge of the zoological project. Given his high social and economic status, Lozano owned numerous estates in different climates, which made collecting animals for his zoological work easier. He went on to write *The Fauna of Cundinamarca* and participated in the publication of *Correo curioso, erudito, económico y mercantil de la ciudad de Santa Fe de Bogotá*, one of the first enlightened journals of the Republic. His work was part of the Spanish Crown's wider search for ways to promote colonial economies through scientific expeditions during the Enlightenment, specifically aiming to identify new products and commodities for export.

As part of his administrative duties within the Spanish empire, Lozano was named lieutenant protector of the Indigenous peoples of Bosa, Fusagasugá, and Usaquén in 1807. With the consolidation of the first government of the Republic, Lozano served as the first president of the United Provinces of New Granada, only to be deposed in 1811 in a coup d'état led by Antonio Nariño. After the Reconquista, Pablo Morillo's forces shot Lozano on July 6th, 1816 for his participation in republican politics in what is now the *Plaza de Los Mártires*.

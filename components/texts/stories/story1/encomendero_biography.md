That year, Maldonado y Mendoza began purchasing estates in the Bogotá savanna and receiving lands awarded by the Spanish Crown. By the mid-1590s, Maldonado y Mendoza was not only the [[encomendero]] of the Indigenous community of Bogotá, but also owned one of the most prosperous cattle ranches in the New Kingdom of Granada.

## The Lawsuit

The *Painting of the lands, marshes, and swamps of the town of Bogotá* was presented as evidence during a 1614 legal proceeding brought by the crown prosecutor of the New Kingdom of Granada against Francisco Maldonado y Mendoza over the ownership of lands in the Bogotá savanna.

An audiencia was a high court of justice in the Spanish colonial administration that also exercised administrative and legislative functions. The Audiencia of Santafé, established in 1549, governed the New Kingdom of Granada (present-day Colombia) and served as both a judicial tribunal and advisory council to royal authorities. Members of the audiencia, called oidores, wielded significant political power in colonial society.

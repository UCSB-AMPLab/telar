An encomendero was a Spanish colonist granted an encomienda—the right to demand tribute and labor from indigenous communities in a specific territory. In theory, encomenderos were responsible for the protection and Christian instruction of indigenous people under their charge. In practice, the encomienda system often resulted in severe exploitation and abuse of indigenous populations. Encomenderos became some of the wealthiest and most powerful figures in colonial society.

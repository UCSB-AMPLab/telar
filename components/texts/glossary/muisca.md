The Muisca were an indigenous people of the Chibcha linguistic family who occupied the Bogotá savanna and surrounding highlands in the eastern Andes of present-day Colombia. They developed sophisticated agricultural, political, and religious systems before Spanish colonization in the 16th century. After conquest, many Muisca communities were subjected to Spanish colonial institutions including encomiendas and reducciones.

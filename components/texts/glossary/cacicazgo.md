The Spanish began to use the terms "cacique" and "cacicazgo" in the islands of the Caribbean after they noticed that Indigenous peoples used these Arawak words to refer to their authorities. From then on, the Spanish used these as generic terms to refer to Indigenous authorities throughout the empire. The Muisca used the term *psihipqua* to designate some of these authorities. The *caciques* that led Muisca communities after the conquest had to change their forms of government in a colonial context in which Indigenous peoples were put under increasing pressure by imperial structures of governance. By the late sixteenth century, the historical record indicates that many *caciques* dressed as Spaniards, used the title "don" and a European name (like don Francisco de Ubaque), and financed murals, masses, and Catholic celebrations.

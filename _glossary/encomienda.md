The encomienda was a labor system instituted by the Spanish crown whereby Spanish colonists were granted the labor of indigenous peoples. In exchange, the encomendero was supposed to provide protection and Christian instruction. In practice, it often resulted in exploitation and harsh treatment of indigenous workers.
